> Create REST API with a GUI

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Create endpoints
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Create resuable models
- ‚ûï Add property types (string, number, boolean, object, array)
- ü¶Ñ [Faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) integration for quickly adding random data
- üîå [Quicktype.io](https://quicktype.io/) integration for converting models and endpoints to C# and TypeScript (properly more to come)

JSON GUI is a tool for making even easier mock up a full REST API for your project. It's a GUI for [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) so you don't have to write JSON or generator functions to set up your API.

Even though it's made for json-server, it can also be used as a JSON generator.


## Getting started

**Install using npm**

``` bash
npm i json-gui
```


**Run it with npx**

``` bash
npx json-gui 
```

**Run it with npm scripts**

Add `"json-gui": "json-gui` to `scripts` property in `package.json` and do

``` bash
npm run json-gui
```

## Future stuff (up for grabs)
[ ] Unit tests

[ ] Importing JSON from another source


## Running the project
``` bash
npm i
npm json-gui (fires up json-server)
npm run dev (has to be run in seperate window)
```
