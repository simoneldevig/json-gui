JSON GUI is a GUI mainly built for [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) but can be used as a JSON generator as well.

## Setting up
``` bash
npm i
npm json-gui (fires up json-server)
npm run dev (has to be run in seperate window)
```

## Features
- Create endpoints
- Create resuable models
- Add property types
  - String
  - Number
  - Boolean
  - Object
  - Array
- [Faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) integration for quickly adding data
- [Quicktype.io](https://quicktype.io/) integration for converting models and endpoints to C# and TypeScript

## Future stuff (up for grabs)
- Unit tests
- Importing JSON from another source
